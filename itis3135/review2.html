            <li><b>Title is h1 + divider + h2:</b>✅</li>

            <li><b>Site colors and fonts using standard css: </b>✅ The website has good contrast, but the colors aren't jumping out at me. I believe a different color combination could have been a better choice.</li>

            <li><b>Main contains unique content: </b>✅</li>
            <li><b>Footer contains "Designed by…" text: </b>❌ There is a footer with a copyright logo, but no "Designed By..." text/</li>
            <li><b>Validation: </b>❌ The validator is being used properly, however there are CSS errors that need to be resolved.</li>
            <li><b>Followed Client Project – Part 2 Instructions: </b>✅</li>
            <li><b>Other suggestions: </b>The website flows well and the different pages have their own functionalities, however the website is visually not pleasing. A different color scheme and more images may be beneficial to the team behind this website.</li>
