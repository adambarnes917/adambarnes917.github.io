        <h2>Tryouts</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provide information about upcoming tryouts and allow users to register their interest in joining the team.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Audience:</strong> Prospective players interested in trying out for the club basketball team.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Page Content:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tryout details: date(s), time(s), location, what to bring.</li>
          <li>Eligibility and requirements (age groups, experience level, waiver info).</li>
          <li>Registration form for players to sign up (name, email, phone, age, preferred position, emergency contact).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Does the user enter data? (Yes/No):</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Does data need validations? (Yes/No):</strong> Yes — required fields: name, email, age; email format validation; optional phone format checks and numeric / range validation for age.</p>
        <p><strong>Does the page contain buttons, hyperlinks or dropdowns? (Yes/No):</strong> Yes — form submission button, navigation links, and possibly dropdowns for position/age group.</p>

        <p><strong>What actions will happen on this page?:</strong> On submit, JavaScript/jQuery will validate inputs. If valid, the data will be sent via AJAX to a mock endpoint or stored locally (for demo). A confirmation message or modal popup will appear after successful submission. Error messages will show inline for missing/invalid fields.</p>

        <p><strong>Special Notes:</strong> Use client-side validation with helpful error text. Consider adding a CAPTCHA or honeypot field if spam is a concern. For the project demo, AJAX can post to a placeholder URL (or simulate success with setTimeout).</p>
        
        <h2>Gallery</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Showcase team photos, highlight events, and provide a visual connection with the community.</p>
        <p>

        <li>Captions or short descriptions for each image (date/event).</li>
        <li>Optional embedded video highlights area (for future use).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Does the user enter data? (Yes/No):</strong> No</p>
        <p><strong>Does data need validations? (Yes/No):</strong> No</p>
        <p><strong>Does the page contain buttons, hyperlinks or dropdowns? (Yes/No):</strong> Yes — navigation links and clickable images that open in a lightbox.</p>

        <p><strong>What actions will happen on this page?:</strong> Clicking an image will open a lightbox gallery (e.g., a jQuery lightbox plugin) where users can navigate between images. Videos, when added, can open in a modal or embed player.</p>

        <p><strong>Special Notes:</strong> Use a jQuery lightbox or similar plugin for a polished viewing experience. Optimize images for web (use thumbnails for the grid and full-size for the lightbox).</p>
    
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Allow interested players, coaches, and community members to reach out to the club for questions, support, or sponsorships.</p>
        <p>
        <strong>Audience:</strong> Prospective players, coaches, sponsors, and community members wanting to connect with the club.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Page Content:</strong></p>

        <li>Club email address and social media links (Twitter/Instagram/Facebook as available).</li>
        <li>Embedded map (iframe) showing the meeting / tryout location (placeholder until venue confirmed).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Does the user enter data? (Yes/No):</strong> Yes</p>
        <p><strong>Does data need validations? (Yes/No):</strong> Yes — all required fields must be filled; email must be validated for proper format; message should have a minimum length (optional).</p>
        <p><strong>Does the page contain buttons, hyperlinks or dropdowns? (Yes/No):</strong> Yes — form submit button, social links, and navigation links.</p>

        <p><strong>What actions will happen on this page?:</strong> When the form is submitted, JavaScript/jQuery will validate inputs then send them via AJAX to a contact endpoint (or simulate with a success message). On success, show a thank-you modal or inline confirmation and optionally clear the form. Map iframe is static and provides location context.</p>

        <p><strong>Special Notes:</strong> Use accessible form markup (labels tied to inputs). Consider server-side backup of contact messages in a real deployment; for the project, a simulated AJAX response is sufficient. Include privacy note if saving contact info.</p>
