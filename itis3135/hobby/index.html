                <p>Lifting is a hobby that I have picked up over the past few years. It started when I was in highschool working out 
                    with the basketball team, and has since become a regular part of my own daily routine.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Benefits: Going to the gym helps me stay fit and active. It improves my strength and confidence as well.</li>
                    <li>Approaches: I do exercises with freeweights (dumbells) and machines, as well as bodyweight exercises like pull ups.</li>
                    <li>Consistency is the most efficient way to keep steady progress when it comes to lifting weights.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I've been going to the gym since freshmam/sophomore year of high school, and I believe it has become a bit of my identity.
                    I primarily focus on building muscle, which includes both lifting consistently and eating enough protein to support growth.
                    This hobby has helped me build discipline and a routine that I enjoy.

                <p>The timing of when I workout depends on what I need to get done that day and when I have free time. Also, I have a split that I follow each week. More details on my split are seen in the table below.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Early morning: I don't usually go early in the morning, as I like to sleep in and have class at 10am throughout the week.</li>
                    <li>Lunch sessions: I usually go around 2:00/3:00 since that time works best for me after class. Also the gym isn't too crowded at this time.</li>
                    <li>Evening: Sometimes when I lift with my friends I will go later in the day. Sometimes I even lift really late at night.</li>

                <p>I have been to many gyms, but the one that is most convenient for me is the Crunch fitness on University Blvd. It is massive and has 
                    all the equipment I could ever need. Other gyms I have been to are listed below.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>UREC: This gym is very nice and has all the different machines. However, when it gets crowded it makes it tough to finish workouts quickly.</li>
                    <li>YMCA: I've been to a few different YMCA's and they are overall very good. The only downside for the YMCA is the expensive membership price.</li>
                    <li>Anytime Fitness: I love this gym because I can go any time of the day. They are open 24/7. I don't have a membership though since it's far from
                        where I live.</li>

                <p>
                    Overall, it doesn't matter where you lift as long as you are consistent and pushing yourself to improve. Any gym with basic equipment will do.

                     like going, I remind myself of why I do it:
